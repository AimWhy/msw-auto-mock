# msw-auto-mock

A cli tool to generate random mock data from OpenAPI descriptions for [msw](https://github.com/mswjs/msw).

## Why

We already have all the type definitions from OpenAPI spec so hand-writing every response resolver is completely unnecessary.

## Usage

Install:

```sh
yarn add msw-auto-mock
```

Read from you OpenAPI descriptions and output generated code:

```sh
# can be http url or a file path on your machine, support both yaml and json.
npx msw-auto-mock http://your_openapi.json -o ./mock.js
```

See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoubingwu/msw-auto-mock/master/example/src/mock.js for Github API example. The msw mocking handlers was generated by following command:

```sh
npx msw-auto-mock https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/rest-api-description/main/descriptions/ghes-3.3/ghes-3.3.json --output ./example/src/mock.js
```

Integrate with msw, see [Mock Service Worker's doc](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started/integrate/browser) for more detail:

```sh
# Install msw
yarn add msw --dev

# Init service worker
npx msw init public/ --save
```

Then import those mock definitions in you app entry:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  import('./mock');
}
```

Run you app then you'll see a successful activation message from Mock Service Worker in your browser's console.
